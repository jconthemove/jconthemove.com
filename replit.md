# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript and Vite.
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing.
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui built on Radix UI primitives.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables.
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state.
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation.

## Backend Architecture
- **Server**: Express.js with TypeScript.
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect.
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store.
- **API Design**: RESTful API with error handling and logging.
- **Build System**: ESBuild for production bundling.

## Database Schema
- **Leads**: Stores quote requests, customer info, service details, status, and employee assignments.
- **Contacts**: Stores general contact form submissions.
- **Users**: Role-based authentication (admin, employee, customer).
- **Status Management**: Leads progress through defined states (new to completed).
- **Job Assignment**: Tracks employee job delegation.
- **Mining Sessions**: Tracks user mining activity, including `lastClaimDate` and `streakCount` for streak bonuses.

## Email Integration
- **Service**: SendGrid for transactional emails.
- **Notifications**: Automated alerts for new leads and contacts.
- **Templates**: HTML and text email templates.

## Authentication & Security
- **Email/Password Authentication**: 
  - Custom bcrypt-hashed authentication system (10 rounds for optimal security/performance balance).
  - No third-party authentication dependencies - ready for Google Play Store deployment.
  - **Public Registration Routes**: `/employee-register`, `/employee-login` accessible without authentication.
  - **Session Fixation Protection**: Session regeneration on login/registration prevents session fixation attacks.
  - **Status-Based Access Control**: Pending users blocked from protected routes; only "active" users can access the platform.
- **Session Management**: 
  - Express sessions with PostgreSQL store for persistence.
  - 90 days (3 months) session duration for extended user sessions.
  - Secure cookie configuration with httpOnly and sameSite protection.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Admin, employee, and customer roles with distinct permissions.
- **Route Protection**: Role-specific and status-aware middleware.
- **Data Isolation**: Employees access available jobs and their own assignments.
- **CORS**: Express CORS middleware.
- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas.
- **Database Security**: Parameterized queries and atomic job assignment.
- **Compliance**: Mandatory age verification (18+) and Terms of Service acceptance.

## Deployment Architecture
- **Production Build**: Static asset generation with Express serving SPA.
- **Environment Variables**: Managed for database, SendGrid, session secrets, and company email.
- **Database Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema management.
- **Graceful Startup**: Error handling prevents service failures from blocking server startup.
- **Production Configuration**: `NODE_ENV=production` for optimized builds.
- **Session Security**: `SESSION_SECRET` for secure session encryption.
- **Health Check Endpoint**: `/health` endpoint for Autoscale Deployment monitoring.
- **Media Asset Storage**: Large media files (>50MB) stored in Replit Object Storage to bypass deployment file size limits. Files uploaded to the `public` directory are served at `/public/<filename>` in both development and production.

### Required Environment Variables for Deployment
- **SESSION_SECRET**: Required for secure session encryption. Should be a random, long string (minimum 32 characters recommended).
- **SENDGRID_API_KEY**: Must be a valid SendGrid API key starting with `SG.` (e.g., `SG.xxxxxxxxxxxxx`). If not provided or invalid, email notifications will be disabled but the app will continue to function.
- **VITE_SOLANA_RPC_URL**: Must be a valid HTTP/HTTPS URL pointing to a Solana RPC endpoint (e.g., `https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com` or `https://api.devnet.solana.com`). This is a frontend environment variable bundled at build time.
- **DATABASE_URL**: PostgreSQL connection string (automatically provided by Replit).
- **NODE_ENV**: Set to `production` for deployment builds.

## UI/UX Decisions
- Modern, responsive design.
- Live price cards with gradient backgrounds and trend indicators.
- Unified mining dashboard displaying streak count and bonus previews.
- Non-dismissible modal for age and TOS compliance.
- "Add a Job" button for employees on mobile dashboard.
- **"IN GOD WE TRUST" Dashboard**: Unified admin interface replacing separate Treasury, Admin, and Moonshot pages with tabbed navigation (Operations, Transfers, Deposits, Analytics, Reconcile).
- **Gradient Navigation**: "IN GOD WE TRUST" link uses blue-to-purple gradient for visual prominence.
- **Clickable Users Card**: Orange "System" card with total users count is clickable, navigating to `/admin/users` with hover effects for better UX.
- **Simplified Navigation**: Removed redundant "Users" tab from header navigation; admins access user management via clickable card in "IN GOD WE TRUST" dashboard.

## Technical Implementations
- Consolidated daily check-in and passive mining into a unified system with linear streak bonuses.
- Implemented employee job creation with bonus rewards for creators.
- Integrated Solana blockchain for treasury management, including real-time balance verification, reconciliation, and deposit recording.
- Real-time JCMOVES token pricing via DexScreener API with fallback mechanism.
- **Token Transfer System**: `/api/treasury/transfer` endpoint enables wallet-to-wallet JCMOVES transfers with validation, balance checks, and database tracking. Supports both record-only and real blockchain execution modes.
- **Unified Admin Dashboard**: "IN GOD WE TRUST" page consolidates all admin features with tabbed navigation (Operations, Safety, Transfers, Deposits, Analytics, Reviews).
- **Treasury Safety Tab**: Spending limits dashboard showing per-transaction (10K), daily (100K), and minimum reserve (50K) limits with security controls status.
- **Real Blockchain Transfers**: `SolanaTransferService` with `TreasuryKeyManager` enables real SPL token transfers when `TREASURY_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` secret is configured.
- **Hybrid Wallet System**: `WalletChoiceModal` lets employees choose between company-generated Solana wallets or connecting personal Phantom wallets.
- **Compliant Swap Request System (Option A)**: Manual review system for token exchanges. Users submit requests at `/request-swap`, admins review in "IN GOD WE TRUST" dashboard → Swaps tab. No live prices, no automated execution, all swaps fulfilled off-platform through treasury or external DEX. Features required compliance acknowledgements, monthly caps (500K tokens), per-user limits (10K/month), and status tracking (pending → approved → completed).
- **Streamlined Navigation**: Removed legacy `/treasury`, `/admin`, and `/admin-moonshot` routes in favor of single unified entry point. Removed redundant "Users" navigation tab from header.
- **Total Earnings Fix**: Admin user details endpoint (`/api/admin/users/:id/details`) now correctly calculates total earnings from ALL rewards instead of only the last 10.
- **AI Crew Assignment Assistant**: Intelligent algorithm suggests optimal crew assignments based on employee workload, performance ratings, experience, and job requirements. Scoring system considers active jobs (-15 pts each), ratings (+20 max), experience (+30 max), and special items handling (+10).
- **Percentage-Based Payout Fee**: Token payouts use a 1% fee (minimum 10 JCMOVES) transferred to IN GOD WE TRUST wallet for the buyback program. Fee is calculated as max(balance * 1%, 10).
- **Token Decimals Fix**: JCMOVES token uses 6 decimals (not 8). Corrected in Solana transfer service to prevent 100x transfer multiplier bug.
- **Customer Rewards System**: Based on 1 JCMOVES = $0.01 valuation:
  - **Lead Creation**: Employees earn 200 JCMOVES ($2) per job created (5/day cap)
  - **Loyalty Booking**: Customers earn 1,500 JCMOVES ($15) when their job completes
  - **Referral Request**: Referrers earn 50 JCMOVES ($0.50) when someone uses their code
  - **Referral Confirmed**: Referrers earn 2,500 JCMOVES ($25) when referred user's first job completes
- **Customer Portal Rewards Display**: Mining tab shows all earning opportunities with dollar values
